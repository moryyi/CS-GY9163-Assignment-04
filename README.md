## About testing
This assignment project has switched from *pytest* to *unittest*.

One of the most important reasons for this is that, by using *pytest*, it is difficult to perform testing along with CSRF protection, provided by **flask_wtf**.

Besides, when using *unittest*, `app.config["WTF_CSRF_ENABLED"] = False` can successfully turn off CSRF protection in order to simply check whether these routes are reachable. But this config setting doesn't work when using *pytest*.

In brief, testcases in this project only perform without CSRF protection and only check whether the requests and responses are successfully sent and received.
